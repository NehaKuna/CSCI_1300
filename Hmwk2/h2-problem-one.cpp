/**
 * Algorithm: Convert a number of seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds.
 * 1. Take the value of the number of seconds.
 * 2. Divide the number of seconds by 3600 (60*60) for number of hours.
 * 3. Take the remaining hours and divide by 60 for number of minutes.
 * 4. Subtract hours and minutes from the total seconds to get remaining seconds.
 * 5. Print the number of hours, minutes, and seconds.
 * 6. Return nothing.
