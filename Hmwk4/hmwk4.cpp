/**
 * Algorithm: Simulate a Jeopardy Dice game.
 * 1. It is first the user's turn.
 * 2. User gets to choose if they want to roll the dice or hold.
 * 3. If the user wants to roll the dice, the dice is rolled. Otherwise it 
 * is the computer's turn.
 * 4. If the dice is rolled: 1 or 6 result in the turn's total equaling zero
 * and the turn switching to the other player. 3 will result in the turn's total
 * equaling fifteen, and the turn switching to the other player. If 2, 4, or 5
 * are rolled, then the turn total is accumulated and the dice is rolled again.
 * 5. The game continues switching between the user and computer until one of
 * their accumulated turn total's is greater than 100.
 * 6. Whichever player reaches 100 or more first wins!
